# Assignment 2: React Clone
## Website: IKEA
## Author: Carly Strathearn 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Description of Application

Re-created a clone of the IKEA website (https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/) using React.

### Website Rationale

For this assignment, the IKEA website was chosen to recreate. This website was selected because of the wide range of components identified. Prior to selecting the IKEA website, the other recommended websites were explored, however because of the number of reusable components in the website, I felt that I could create a selection of components that could be reused if I ever wanted to expand on the website. For example, a product card component was created to contain artificial plant products. This product card component could easily be reused on a different page to display a different category of products.

### Page Rationale

The pages that I selected to recreate were the Artificial Plant page and the Login page. 

The Artificial Plant page was selected because of the variety of components that I identified in it. For example, the first reusable component I identified was the navigation bar. In addition to this, I also identified the product cards containing products, the filter button to sort the products on a given page, and the footer component. I felt that these components were pieces of UI that were common and key to all the product pages featured on the IKEA website. 

Additionally, the Login page was selected because I identified the login form and submit button as key functional elements of the IKEA website.

### Component Rationale

#### Artificial Plant Page (/ArtificialPlantPage)

  **(1) Header Component** 
        -Selected to broadcast important messages to customers, messages can easily be removed or added to this component.
        -For example, a fourth message could be added to the header if need be.
        
  **(2) Navigation Bar Component**
        -Selected because a navigation bar is an important element to all websites as it helps guide users along.
        -Additionally, the navigation bar is a reusable component that is displayed in a majority of the IKEA web pages.
        
  **(3) Filter Component**
        -Selected because the filter component is featured on all of IKEA’s product pages to allow users to sort the products into categories.
        -This component can be easily reused on different pages if the IKEA React Clone was expanded on.
        
  **(4) Product Card Component**
        -Selected because the product card component is featured on all of IKEA’s product pages to contain each product that IKEA sells.
        -This component can be easily reused on different pages if the IKEA React Clone was expanded on for example it could be displayed on the sofa page to contain different           sofa products.
        
  **(5) Footer Component**
        -Selected because a footer is an important element to all websites as it contains quick links for users to access.
        
#### Login Page (/LoginPage)

  **(6) Login Form**
        -Selected because the login component is necessary to authenticate IKEA members and allow them reap the benefits of having an IKEA account. 
        
  **(7) Submission Button**
        -Selected because a submission button is a key component of the IKEA login form to allow for the submission of data.
